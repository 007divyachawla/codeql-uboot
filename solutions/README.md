# CodeQL U-Boot challenge (C/C++): sample solutions

This folder contains sample solutions for each step of the course.
They are there to help you if you get stuck, but please try to solve the tasks on your own first using the course hints, editor auto-completion, and documentation!

There are often many ways to write the same CodeQL query. These solutions are just examples, and you may come up with other good ways to solve the same tasks.

Happy query writing!
